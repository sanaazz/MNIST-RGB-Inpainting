# MNIST-RGB-Inpainting

In this part, we design and train two different neural network models for image the inpainting task. In short, inpainting is a process of filling in the missing parts of an image.

The link to dataset is [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

**Using PyTorch is mandatory** for this Code.

Note that this code needs a CUDA-enabled GPU to be able to train the models in a reasonable time. If you do not have one, it is suggested to use the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment.
